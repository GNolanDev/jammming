# Jammming

## Aim

A project set by Codecademy as part of the full stack path. Uses Create-React-App as a base, html templates given. My job was to create all the components and connect them up, then connect to the Spotify API to fetch songs & create new playlists on the user's account.
This was a good overview of how React single page apps are arranged, a chance to see how API documentation works, an opportunity to use build tools, and an introduction to a simple way of deploying via 'surge'.

## Technologies

- ECMAScript 6
- React

## Requirements

Hosted on [surge](http://gnolandevjammming.surge.sh/).
